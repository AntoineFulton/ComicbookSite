# Comic Collection Capstone

I and a small group were given 9 business days to build a full-stack web application requiring the use of Vue.js, a ProstgreSQL Database, an external API accessed via Spring Boot, and a Java Backend using RESTful API<br>
In addition, we were required to adhere to at least the following user stories

## User stories
- As an anonymous user, I should be able to:
  - create an account
  - log into an account
  - see a user's public collections
- As a logged-in user, I should be able to:
  - Create collections
  - Add comics to my collections
  - Remove comics from my collections
  - Delete collections
  - Add friends
  - Remove friends
  - View friends' private collections

We completed all of these within the allotted time and even more. The features that we added include the following:
